# Cross Axis (working title)

An app that allows users to plan future tasks on a cross-axis board with draggable notes. The notes can collapse down so a number of them can fit on the board and can be edited and re-positioned by multiple users in a collaborative fashion.

This project is in the inital stages, so there are many missing features and work is still being done.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
